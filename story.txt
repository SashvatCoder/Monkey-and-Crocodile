Once upon a time in a forest there was a monkey who resided on a berry tree which was on a bounce of a river.
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife.....
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The next day the crocodile came back for some more fruits as he loved them.
As days past by the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
